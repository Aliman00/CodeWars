# * The two functions expected are named 'min' and 'max' and are exactly
#   the same as the two built-in functions of the same names.
#
# * This import is simply for the tests (even though it's unnecessary)
#
# * You could have just this import below as the solution but even that
#   is unnecessary because 'min' and 'max' are built-in and don't need
#   to be imported

from __builtin__ import max, min
